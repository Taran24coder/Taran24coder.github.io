   Hi all, 
I have successfully completed the "Excel for Beginners" course offered by Great Learning Academy. 
This course is very awesome and it helps to cover many important Excel formulas with alot of information 
Such as in this I was able to learn many things like
1. Filtering and Sorting- of data by which we can easily able to get required information among a huge list
2. Formulas such as 
 • Index
 • Vlookup
 • Hlookup
 • Offget function
 • Concatenate
 • Basic arithmetic operations like mean, mode, varience, average and many more.
 This was a wonderful experience to polish all useful points of Excel. Such as this is a very useful application to do our work in a very easy manner. Also, in this if we have almost a record of upto 100 pearson and we have to make a welcome letter for all we can just use mail merge with which we give required conditions and get our results in just some 2-3 minutes.
